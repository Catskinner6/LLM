{"input": "text chunks", "output": "(OTS Parts) competition among suppliers should offer potential benefits for outsourcing both physical production activities and the information processing activities associated with product design. Conversely, a lack of competition among many suppliers (i.e., supplier concentration) creates an incentive for the manufacturer to internalize an activity in order to avoid the exercise of monopoly power by a supplier."}
{"input": "text chunks", "output": "(OTS Parts) When a supplier provides goods or services to many customers, this supplier may achieve greater economies of scale than could a customer providing the same goods or services for itself. Achieving this benefit requires that the goods or services be standardized and that there be fewer suppliers than customers. External economies of scale are familiar in component production, yet may also be present in product design. For example, when designers can employ expensive and specialized automation tools, may be scale advantages to procuring these design services from a supplier who specializes in these activities."}
{"input": "text chunks", "output": "(OTS Parts) for a given required lead-time, the capacity required for a shared resource can be substantially less than the sum of the capacities required to service multiple sources of demand independently. These economies apply to both design and production activities. Design activities tend to experience substantial variability in demand, because the timing of episodes of product development is often more \u201clumpy\u201d than are the production schedules of the associated products."}

In the presence of such assets, both supplier and customer face small-numbers bargaining and the associated threat of opportunistic behavior on the part of the other party."}
{"input": "text chunks", "output": "(Unique Parts) A central idea in the field of competitive strategy is that a firm is a locus of competitively distinctive capabilities. Because these capabilities can be quite \u201csticky\u201d (i.e.,difficulttotransfer), a firm can develop a competitive advantage by investing in their development"}
{"input": "text chunks", "output": "(Unique Parts) There are also appropriability issues associated with design and production activities. When outsourcing an activity, there is a risk that intellectual property may spill over to competitive firms (Teece1986). Similarly, outsourcing an activity to a supplier presents a risk that this supplier may develop into a competitor. These risks may motivate a firm to internalize activities critical to its competitive advantage."}
{"input": "text chunks", "output": "(Unique Parts) Outsourcing generally requires that a contract can be written that anticipates likely contingencies. Creating a robust contract will be difficult in situations where there is a high likelihood of an unpredictable exogenous disturbance in the task requirements, perhaps due to an unexpected change in market requirements. When unanticipated disturbances occur, contract renegotiation is likely, with the associated small-numbers bargaining problems. As a result, the firm is likely to wish to internalize the activities subject to such disturbances"}

{"input": "text chunks", "output": "When a material and its associated fabrication process are new, designers must collaborate closely with those operating the production process to arrive at a design that both functions as desired and can be feasibly and economically produced. Therefore, we would predict that frames employing new materials would benefit from being both designed and produced by the same organizational entity."}
