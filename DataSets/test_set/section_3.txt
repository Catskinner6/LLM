in their product lines. Therefore, wefeel it is more appropriate to consider the ﬁrm as theunit of analysis. For the three exceptions, we create aseparate observation for each different type of sourc-ing decision made by the ﬁrm. The study variables are as follows:D, Design (0,1). Dis 1 if the frame design activity is performed internally and 0 if it is performed by asupplier. We deﬁned frame design as the activity inwhich computer models or drawings are created. P, Production (0,1). Pis 1 if the frame production activity is performed internally and 0 if it is performedby a supplier. No manufacturer makes tubing or otherraw materials, and so frame manufacturing alwaysand unambiguously comprises frame fabrication andﬁnishing. M, New Material (0,1). Mis 1 if the ﬁrm offers frames made from titanium, GFRP, or metal-matrixcomposite; and 0 otherwise (i.e., for ﬁrms offeringframes made only from steel or aluminum). S, Unique Suspension (0,1). Firms offering full sus- pension designs were asked to assess the uniquenessof their own full suspension designs on a scale from 1 Figure 5 An example of a mountain bicycle with a frame made from a “new material”— graphite ﬁber reinforced polymer.

Ulrich and Ellison: Beyond Make-Buy: Internalization and Integration of Design and Production Production and Operations Management 14(3), pp. 315–330, © 2005 Production and Operations Management Society 323(not unique) to 7 (highly unique). Unique-Suspension is 1 for ﬁrms with a self-reported suspension rating of4 or greater; and 0 otherwise. This variable is 0 forﬁrms that do not offer frames with full suspension. Webelieve that self-assessment of suspension uniquenessis appropriate because the relevant factor is how theﬁrm has conceived of its competitive strategy, notnecessarily how well it has executed that strategy. Q, Quantity (0,1). Qis 0 if the ﬁrm lacks efﬁcient scale and 1 if the ﬁrm has achieved minimum efﬁcientscale. We estimate the relative scale of a company byﬁrst estimating annual unit volume (Table 5). Respon-dents were provided with seven volume categories tochoose from. Our estimate of volume is usually themid-point of the range used to deﬁne a category.However, the highest-volume choice was unbounded(/H11022200,000 units/year). We use a volume estimate of 300,000 for ﬁrms in this category 6.We then estimate the average volume of each basic material used by theﬁrm, i.e., volume/N, where N is the number of basicmaterials used by the ﬁrm (e.g., aluminum, steel, tita- nium, GFRP). When volume/N is greater than 50,000units per year, then Q is 1, and is 0 otherwise. Volumeis typically not distributed evenly across the materials,but the average volume per material gives an approx-imation of the scale of the company. The choice of avolume cut-off of was based on discussions with in-dustry experts, but there are only two ﬁrms withvalues near the cut-off of 50,000 units per year. Ourresults would not change signiﬁcantly if this cut-offwere anywhere between 38,000 units per year and100,000 units per year. U, Unique-Process (0,1). U is 1 if the ﬁrm employs a competitively distinctive process in production, and0 otherwise. Based on interviews with ﬁve industryexperts, we identiﬁed three ﬁrms in the sample forwhich such capabilities are a key basis of competition.Crestone 7and Cannon compete in part by offering unique composite frame technology. In both cases, thetechnology is given a trademark and is prominent inthe ﬁrms’ positioning of the products made with thetechnology. Shasta specializes in titanium frames, en-tered the bicycle market from the specialty titaniumfabrication business, and is known in the market as theleading titanium processor. These are unambiguouslythe only ﬁrms in this category and there was no dis-agreement about this categorization. For these threeﬁrms, we assign Ua value of 1. In sum, we hypothesize that for internally consis- tent organizational decisions:H1. a ﬁrm with competitively unique suspensions per - forms frame design internally ; H2. a ﬁrm with competitively unique production pro - cesses performs frame production internally ; H3. a ﬁrm that does not produce quantity sufﬁcient to achieve minimum efﬁcient scale ,and that does not have unique production processes ,outsources production ; H4. a ﬁrm using new frame materials either does both frame design and production internally or outsources bothactivities to the same supplier . Note that we are not assuming causality in making these arguments. For example, we are not necessarilyasserting that ﬁrms wishing to offer unique suspen-sion designs therefore choose to internalize their frame design activity. Rather we are asserting thatunique suspension design and internalized frame de-sign form a coherent pair of marketing and organiza-tional decisions. An alternative interpretation is that aﬁrm with existing internal design capability chooses topursue a market strategy based around unique sus-pension design, or that this design capability and mar-ket strategy evolved simultaneously. These interpre-tations are also consistent with our theory. 4.3. Empirical Evidence There are 16 possible combinations of the 2 values(0,1) for the 4 variables (Q, U, S, and M). There are fourpossible organizational forms corresponding to out-sourcing or internalizing design or production (D/H110051/P/H110051, D/H110051/P/H110050, D/H110050/P/H110051, and D /H110050/P /H110050). This combination of 4 organizational choices for 16 combinations of the contextual variables leads to 64possible scenarios. In Table 1, we display these 64scenarios and we indicate with shading the scenariosthat exhibit misﬁt with respect to one or more hypoth- eses. The speciﬁc hypotheses responsible for the misﬁtare noted in the cells. The values of the study variables and the actual organizational choices for our 23 observations areshown in Table 3. Although we intend the theory to beevaluated as an integrated whole, as a ﬁrst-order test,we can evaluate the predictions of the hypothesestaken individually. These results are shown in Table 4.This ﬁrst-order analysis provides statistically signiﬁ-cant support for Hypotheses 1, 2, and 3. The results forHypothesis 4 are in the predicted direction, but notstatistically signiﬁcant given only 10 relevant observa-tions. In Table 2, we populate the 64 possible scenarioswith the 23 empirical observations. We can assert withstatistical conﬁdence that the empirical observationsare not randomly distributed among the 64 cells.However, a statistically valid analysis of the inte-grated theory, including a simultaneous test of all four 6Our results are not sensitive to this estimate, and we would make identical predictions if we used a value of 200,000. 7All names of ﬁrms in this section are disguised.Ulrich and Ellison: Beyond Make-Buy: Internalization and Integration of Design and Production 324 Production and Operations Management 14(3), pp. 315–330, © 2005 Production and Operations Management Societyhypotheses that would illuminate the role of each variable is not feasible with 64 possible logical cellsand only 23 observations. 5. Discussion 5.1. Discussion of OutliersExamination of the decisions that are not consistentwith our theory is instructive. There are three suchcases. In the case of Everest 2, we predicted that theﬁrm would internalize design because it offered aunique suspension design; but instead it outsourcesdesign. Interestingly, this ﬁrm licenses two suspensionpatents from a leading independent suspension de-signer with a background in motorcycle design. The existence of patents mitigates some of the appropri-ability concerns associated with outsourcing design,and allows this company to both have a unique designand to outsource the design to its supplier. Note thatour deﬁnition of design is also important here. Wemeasured who does design by who controls the com-puter-aided design model of the product. In this case,the ﬁrm speciﬁes the basic geometry of the frame,derived from the patent, and then the supplier com-pletes the details of the design. The same manufacturer internalizes design and out- sources production of a frame built from a new mate-Table 1 All 64 Possible Organizational Scenarios.

However, it outsources to a supplier that is located only a short drive away from the ofﬁcein which the designers work. This allows the two ﬁrmsto coordinate closely on design and production issues.This example reinforces the idea that, while organiza-tional integration may facilitate interaction, practicalintegration may be achieved by forms other than con-solidation in the same legal entity (Dyer 1997). In the third case (Kilimanjaro), a ﬁrm offers a unique suspension design, but outsources design. In this case,we learned that the frame geometry is created inter- nally, but the computer model is created by the man-ufacturer. This division of effort may allow the ﬁrm toTable 3 Actual Organizational Choices for Firms and Frames in the Sample.

Why Does No One Outsource Design and Internalize Production? We noted in Section 3 that there are four theoreticalorganizational forms corresponding to internalizationor outsourcing of design and production. However,we observe that no ﬁrm outsources design while in-ternalizing production. In some of our related research(Ulrich and Ellison 1999), we also observed that thiswas the pattern for the vast majority of manufacturersfrom a sample of 225 engineered, assembled goods. In the mountain bicycle industry, we observe that only three manufacturers have a strong motive tointernalize production because of unique materialsprocessing capabilities. Absent a strong motive for internalization, the only reason to do production in-ternally is to integrate it with an internal design activ-ity. This suggests that internal production, in mostcases, will only occur in conjunction with internaldesign. The exception would be the ﬁrms that competebased on their materials processing capabilities. In oursample, these ﬁrms also offered unique suspensiondesigns and so internalized design. Interestingly, inone of these cases, the ﬁrm was very late in developinga unique suspension. It initially licensed a well-knownsuspension design, which is a form of design out-sourcing. Conceptually, ﬁrms that internalize production, but outsource design can be thought of as “publishers.”The analogy is to book publishers, who brand (andsometimes print) the “designs” of outsiders. This or-ganizational form is also seen in fashion and furniture,where a designer may be an independent contractor toa manufacturer. We speculate that this organizationalform is competitively viable in industries where pro-duction and distribution are important competitively,but where the quality of product designs is very dif-ﬁcult to predict and may be based on taste or fashion.Because these conditions are rare in engineered, as-sembled goods, we speculate that this organizationalform will also be rare, occurring only in transientcases. 5.3. Managing Conﬂicting Motives for Organizational Structure An organizational design conﬂict arises when there isa net motive to externalize one activity, to internalizeanother, and to integrate the two. In the case of bicycleframes, such a situation arises when a ﬁrm wishes todevelop a unique suspension design using a new ma-terial, but does not have sufﬁcient volume to produceefﬁciently internally. Such a ﬁrm is faced with thepossibility of either: (1) splitting design and produc-tion activities that could beneﬁt from integration, (2)internalizing an activity that would beneﬁt from being outsourced (most often production), or (3) outsourc-ing an activity that would beneﬁt from being internal-ized (most often design). Several strategies may beeffective in mitigating the risks associated with thesecompromises. In the ﬁrst case, splitting two activities that could beneﬁt from integration results in a need for non-hierarchical mechanisms for organizational integra-tion. Dyer (1997) explores several such mechanisms indepth. He ﬁnds that in the automobile industry, geo-graphic proximity and the use of face-to-face meetingsbetween members of cooperating but separate organi-zations can be effective in integrating their activities.In some cases, it may be possible to locate people fromtwo different organizations in the same workspace inorder to minimize coordination costs and maximizethe probability of joint problem solving. In the case ofproduct design, such co-location does not present sub-stantial geographic asset speciﬁcity, because it is easyfor the designer to simply move back to his/her homeorganization should the relationship fail. Adler (1995)reviews speciﬁc coordination mechanisms for designand production which include producibility designreviews and joint teams, which may also be effective.Agency issues may be minimized when there are re-peated exchanges over a long time period. We observethat all of these mechanisms are used by Everest in itsrelationships with its frame supplier. In the second case, internalizing an activity that would beneﬁt from being outsourced poses the threatof substantially increased costs and/or ﬁnancial risk.In the bicycle industry, the most common example ofthis compromise is internalizing production when theﬁrm does not have substantial volume. The cost andﬁnancial risks, in this case, are presumably out-weighed by the beneﬁts of integrating design andproduction, and/or of internalizing design. In suchsituations, one mitigating approach may be to adaptthe product’s design and associated production pro-cess to accentuate and further exploit the potentialbeneﬁts of integration and/or internalization. For ex-ample, in bicycle frames, such strategies could includehigh levels of customization (e.g., in sizes or colors) orseeking processing innovations that may offer aunique competitive advantage. In the third case, outsourcing an activity that would beneﬁt from internalization presents risks of losing (ornot developing) a valuable capability. These risks arediscussed by Anderson and Parker (2002). In the bi-cycle domain, such situations arise when a ﬁrm wishesto offer a unique product design, but outsources de-sign to its supplier because of the need to integratedesign and production. Contractual strategies are of-ten attempted in these situations and may be partiallyeffective. These include non-disclosure agreements, Ulrich and Ellison: Beyond Make-Buy: Internalization and Integration of Design and Production Production and Operations Management 14(3), pp. 315–330, © 2005 Production and Operations Management Society 327non-compete agreements, and assignment of patent rights. However, suppliers are unlikely to enter intostrict contractual agreements when there is substantialdemand for their services and productive capacity. Amore effective strategy may be to separate conceptualdesign and system-level design from detail design. Inthe case of frame design, much of the interaction be-tween
