because of the need to integratedesign and production. Contractual strategies are of-ten attempted in these situations and may be partiallyeffective. These include non-disclosure agreements, Ulrich and Ellison: Beyond Make-Buy: Internalization and Integration of Design and Production Production and Operations Management 14(3), pp. 315–330, © 2005 Production and Operations Management Society 327non-compete agreements, and assignment of patent rights. However, suppliers are unlikely to enter intostrict contractual agreements when there is substantialdemand for their services and productive capacity. Amore effective strategy may be to separate conceptualdesign and system-level design from detail design. Inthe case of frame design, much of the interaction be-tween design and production is at a detailed level andconcerns issues such as tubing thicknesses, joint an-gles, and location of ﬁxturing points. To the extent thatthe conceptual and system design can be done by themanufacturer, while allowing the supplier to performdetailed design, some of the risks of outsourcing de-sign may be mitigated. This appears to be one of thestrategies pursued by Kilimanjaro. 5.4. Complex Products and Systems Our discussion has focused on relatively simple net-works of activities such as those associated with thedesign and production of a single product-speciﬁccomponent such as a bicycle frame. Even in this sim-ple setting organizational challenges arise frequentlybecause of the conﬂicting motives for outsourcing,internalizing, and/or integration. These challenges areeven more pronounced for complex systems compris-ing dozens of subsystems and thousands of compo-nents, and for families of products comprising manyvariants. In such settings, architectural choices becomeprominent (Ulrich 1995) and the problem of platformoptimization emerges (Gupta and Krishnan 1999). Thecomplexity of the production process provides addi-tional decision problems related to internalizing oroutsourcing process and equipment design (Fine andWhitney 1996). 5.5. Dynamics and Path Dependence The factors that motivate a particular organizationalform are dynamic. As a result, organizations are likelyto be compelled to adapt over time. In the bicycleindustry, theory predicts that a dominant suspensiondesign will emerge (Abernathy and Utterback 1978).When this occurs, ﬁrms that have internalized designwill need to innovate around some new element of theproduct or in a new product category, or may beneﬁtfrom outsourcing design to suppliers. What is a newmaterial today will be a mature material in 10 years.As materials mature, design rules will emerge, whichwill allow design and production to be disintegrated.This will provide new opportunities for suppliers andnew challenges for integrated manufacturers. What isa distinctive materials processing capability todaymay some day be commonplace. Under these condi-tions, ﬁrms that have internalized production in orderto develop unique materials processing capabilitieswill face increasing pressure to allow increasingly ca-pable suppliers to provide productive capacity.Although we present the factors associated with internalization and integration as deterministic, thedynamics are somewhat path dependent. A ﬁrm thatat one point, for good reason, developed a substantialinternal production capability will be less likely tooutsource its production than a new entrant even ifthe motives for outsourcing are quite compelling. Thisis partially due to organizational inertia, but also be-cause of very real commitments, especially in smallerprivately held companies, to an established workforce. There may also be path dependence in design. Co- hen and Levinthal (1990) argue that relevant internalR&D activities increase a ﬁrms “absorbtive capaci-ty”—its ability to recognize and acquire relevant out-side technological information. This suggests that if aﬁrm sheds its design activities completely, it may failto recognize technological opportunities in the future. 6. Summary We have argued that there is a useful distinction be-tween motives for internalizing an activity within theorganization of the manufacturer, and the motives forintegrating two activities into the same organizationalentity, which may or may not be the manufacturer. Given this distinction, decisions about internalizingdesign and internalizing production cannot be fullyunderstood in isolation. They are joint decisions be-cause of the motives for integration of design andproduction. For the design and production of product-speciﬁc components, four organizational forms arepossible in theory: (1) internal design, internal produc-tion; (2) internal design, external production; (3) ex-ternal design, internal production; and (4) externaldesign, external production. We argue that “Make”and “Buy” do not reﬂect the distinctions among thesecategories. For bicycle frames, form (4)—external de-sign with internal production—does not happen inpractice. We speculate that this form is rare in generalfor engineered goods. We argue that design and production activities can be disintegrated when production processes have ma-tured to the point where there are explicit design rulesthat express the constraints and capabilities of theproduction process. A potential organizational conﬂictarises when there is a high need to integrate twoactivities, but a strong motive to outsource one of theactivities and internalize the other. Several mecha-nisms may be useful in mitigating potential weak-nesses in the organizational compromises that resultfrom such situations, including the use of non-hierar-chical mechanisms for organizational integration andthe decomposition of design tasks into conceptual de-sign and design-for-manufacturing, which would bethen split across two organizations.Ulrich and Ellison: Beyond Make-Buy: Internalization and Integration of Design and Production 328 Production and Operations Management 14(3), pp. 315–330, © 2005 Production and Operations Management SocietyAcknowledgments This article evolved from a working paper written in 1998 (Ulrich and Ellison 1998).
