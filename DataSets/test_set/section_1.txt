This issue, generally labeled the “make-buy” decision, has received substantial theoretical and empiricalattention. In this paper, we broaden the scope of the make-buy decision to include product designdecisions, as well as production decisions. First, we examine independently the decisions of whether tointernalize design and production, and then we consider how design and production organizationaldecisions are interdependent. The speciﬁc research questions we address are: (1) How can design andproduction sourcing decisions be described in richer terms than “make” and “buy”? (2) Do existingtheories of vertical integration apply to product design activities as well as production decisions?(3) What is the relationship between the organization of design and the organization of production?(4) What organizational forms for design and production are seen in practice?

Introduction Much recent attention in industrial practice has been centered on the question of which activities a manu-facturing ﬁrm should perform itself and for which itshould rely on outside suppliers. A trend appears tobe towards reducing the scope of internal activitiesand relying to a greater extent on suppliers. Yet, sev-eral very different organizational arrangements fordesign and production have been adopted in manu- facturing ﬁrms. For example, in the computer indus-try, some ﬁrms perform both design and productioninternally. Other ﬁrms perform their own design, butcontract with suppliers for production. In a third or-ganizational form, a company such as Hewlett-Pack-ard, contracts with a supplier to both design and pro- duce products to its speciﬁcations. Similar alternatives seem to be present for the manufacture of automotivecomponents, with some ﬁrms performing their owndesign and production; others performing design, butnot production; and a third type relying on suppliers for both design and production. We are interested inexplaining these organizational forms, and speciﬁ-cally, in understanding what, if any, connections thereare between who performs design and who performsproduction. The boundaries of the ﬁrm have been a central concern for several decades in the ﬁeld of industrialorganization, and there exists a wealth of theoreticaland empirical analysis on the subject. Determiningwhat to do in house versus what to outsource 1is often called the make-buy decision , presumably because in manufacturing settings, the ﬁrm must decide whichcomponents of a product to make and which to buyfrom suppliers. The make-buy decision is equivalent 1We recognize that some people object to using the words “out- source” and “source” as verbs; however, this usage is dominant inindustrial practice and so we adopt it here.POMS PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT Vol. 14, No. 3, Fall 2005, pp. 315–330issn 1059-1478 /H2084105 /H208411403 /H20841315$1.25 © 2005 Production and Operations Management Society 315to a vertical integration decision when the ﬁrm faces a choice of whether or not to backward integrate asource of supply. There are several gaps in the existing research. First, most empirical research is focused on a linear valuechain involving the production of goods, ignoring de- sign activities, which are essentially information pro-cessing activities. For example, Harrigan (1986) looksat production activities in industrial and consumergoods. Monteverde and Teece (1982a) and Walker andWeber (1987) study production of automobile compo-nents. MacDonald (1985) examines production deci-sions across SIC codes 20 to 39 (basic materials andassembled goods) and Masten (1984) looks at aero-space production. Notable exceptions to this general-ization are Pisano (1990), who examines R&D sourcingdecisions in the biotechnology industry, and Novakand Eppinger (2001) who study automotive compo-nent sourcing. Second, the literature tends to addressthe decision to integrate a single activity in isolation,and tends not to consider interactions between two ormore sourcing decisions. In our case, we are interestedin both design and production , and believe that design and production decisions are often interdependentand cannot always be analyzed in isolation. Third,much of the research on make-buy does not distin-guish between the sourcing of standard componentsand the sourcing of product-speciﬁc components. As aresult of these factors, for example, the “buy” categoryis used to describe some very different situations,including: sourcing production of a product-speciﬁc compo-nent that is designed internally, “black-box” sourcing of a product-speciﬁc auto-motive component in which both design and pro-duction are done by a single supplier (Asanuma1985; 1989; Clark 1989; Clark and Fujimoto 1991;Liker et al. 1996), sourcing of a product-speciﬁc component inwhich one supplier does the design and a seconddoes production, and sourcing of a standard component from the cata-log of a supplier. In this paper, we broaden the scope of the make-buy decision to include product design decisions as well as production decisions. The speciﬁc questions we ad-dress are: (1) How can design and production sourc-ing decisions be described in richer terms than “make”and “buy”? (2) Do existing theories of vertical integra-tion apply to product design activities as well as toproduction? (3) What is the relationship between theorganization of design and the organization of pro-duction? (4) What organizational forms for design andproduction are seen in practice? While our principal focus is product design and production, our theory applies to the general problemof industrial organization of a network of intercon- nected activities, some of which may be informationprocessing activities, while others may involve thetransformation of physical materials. We apply and interpret existing theory of industrial organization in the context of product design andproduction. We add to this theory by articulating adistinction between internalization and integration,and by considering the coupling among sourcing de-cisions. We then explore our theory with an empiricalanalysis of bicycle frame sourcing in the U.S. moun-tain bicycle industry. 1.1. Conceptual Framework We focus on engineered goods and we assume theperspective of a ﬁrm supplying a branded product tothe market. We assume that this ﬁrm also speciﬁes its products (i.e., deliberately designates the characteris-tics of the products it intends to supply). We call suchﬁrms manufacturers , although they may or may not literally produce their own products. A central chal-lenge of the manufacturer is to arrange for the com-pletion of a set of design and production activities inorder to deliver its products to the market. In the literature on industrial organization, there are two classic approaches to the organizational challengeof coordinating these design and production tasks:markets and hierarchies (Williamson 1975). Markets rely on self-interested exchanges (selling and buying) onthe part of suppliers and purchasers to coordinate thecompletion of work. Hierarchies rely on the authorityassociated with legal ownership to assign and monitorwork to subsidiary entities. This classiﬁcation is com-plicated in practice by the widespread use of interme-diate forms. Contractual arrangements, while gener-ally considered market mechanisms, can detail theterms and conditions of a transaction and anticipatesome contingencies. Furthermore, some whollyowned subsidiaries of manufacturers behave in manyrespects as if they were independent suppliers oper-ating in a competitive market. 1.2. Distinction between Internalization and Integration The literature generally considers the organizationalintegration of activities along a linear, temporal se-quence of physical transformation processes. Vertical integration within this framework is the consolidation of successive stages of this sequence into the samelegal entity. In our work, we make a distinction between inter- nalization and integration . Internalization is the inclusion of an activity within the organizational boundaries of the man-ufacturer, the entity on which our analysis focuses. Integration is the consolidation of two or moreUlrich and Ellison: Beyond Make-Buy: Internalization and Integration of Design and Production 316 Production and Operations Management 14(3), pp. 315–330, © 2005 Production and Operations Management Societyactivities into the same organizational entity, whether or not this entity is the manufacturer . Note that when this consolidation of activities occurswithin the manufacturer, the activities are bothintegrated and internalized. That is, if two activ-ities are internalized, they are also integrated.However, the converse is not always true: twoactivities can be integrated into the organizationof a single supplier and not be internalized withrespect to the manufacturer. Note that we useintegration to refer to the inclusion of two activi- ties within the scope of the same organization andnot to the technological activity of integration in the sense articulated by Iansiti (1998). In the next section, we review the basic motives for internalizing or not internalizing (i.e., outsourcing) anactivity. We discuss the implications of these motivesfor both production and design activities. Section 3combines these perspectives into implications for or-ganizational structure. Section 4 tests the key ideas ofthe paper with empirical evidence from the mountainbicycle industry. Section 5 contains discussion andconcluding remarks. 2. Internalization and Integration in Activity Networks In this section, we ﬁrst consider the motives for not internalizing an activity (i.e., for outsourcing) andthen consider when internalization may offer beneﬁtsto the ﬁrm. We then outline the motives for integratingtwo activities, whether or not they are internalized.These motives are summarized in Figure 1. Note thatmany of the issues discussed in this section and thenext have been well established in prior theoreticaland empirical work. We provide this review to con-solidate the arguments, and for the beneﬁt of thosereaders who are not familiar with the relevant litera-ture. Those familiar with this literature may skip toSection 3. For those interested in reviewing this liter-ature in more detail, see Mahoney’s comprehensivereview (1992) or the textbook by Tirole (2001). 2.1. Outsourcing Versus Internalization The market mechanism of organizing manufacturing(i.e., outsourcing) offers several compelling potentialbeneﬁts to a manufacturer. Competition Among Suppliers. Heralded for more than 200 years, the beneﬁt of competition amongsuppliers in a free market is the most fundamental ofmotives and generally forms the backdrop againstwhich all other factors are considered (Smith 1776). Allother factors equal, competition among suppliersshould offer potential beneﬁts for outsourcing bothphysical production activities and the informationprocessing activities associated with product design.Conversely, a lack of competition among many sup- pliers (i.e., supplier concentration) creates an incentivefor the manufacturer to internalize an activity in orderto avoid the exercise of monopoly power by a supplier. This dynamic of internalization in response to supplier concentration has been articulated by Fine (1999; 2000)for the computer and automobile industries. External Economies of Scale. When a supplier pro- vides goods or services to many customers, this sup-plier may achieve greater economies of scale thancould a customer providing the same goods or ser-vices for itself. Achieving this beneﬁt requires that thegoods or services be standardized and that there befewer suppliers than customers. (See Thompson 1954for a fascinating discussion of this phenomenon in theearly automobile industry.) External economies ofscale are familiar in component production, yet mayalso be present in product design. For example, whendesigners can employ expensive and specialized au-tomation tools, may be scale advantages to procuringthese design services from a supplier who specializesin these activities. 2 Responsiveness to Variability in Demand. A basic 2Although work by Zenger (1994) suggests that there may be dis - economies of scale in research and development due to smallerﬁrms’ abilities to offer employment contracts that are more closelytied to individual performance.Figure 1 (A) Summary of motives for outsourcing versus internalizing an activity A, and (B) summary of motives for integratingactivities A and B, whether or not they are internalized. Ulrich and Ellison: Beyond Make-Buy: Internalization and Integration of Design and Production Production and Operations Management 14(3), pp. 315–330, © 2005 Production and Operations Management Society 317result from statistics and queueing theory is that when independent sources of demand are pooled, then thevariability in aggregate demand is less than that ofthese independent sources. This property implies thatfor a given required lead-time, the capacity requiredfor a shared resource can be substantially less than thesum of the capacities required to service multiplesources of demand independently 3.These economies apply to both design and production activities. Designactivities tend to experience substantial variability indemand, because the timing of episodes of productdevelopment is often more “lumpy” than are the pro-duction schedules of the associated products. Immediate Access to Capabilities. A ﬁrm pursu- ing a new market opportunity or employing a newproduct or process technology may need access to anew capability immediately. Many such capabilitiesrequire time to procure internally and so, in the shortterm, a manufacturer must outsource an activity to acompetent supplier. This is a transient issue, in thatmost capabilities can be acquired through investmentof time and/or money. This factor applies to bothdesign and production activities. Minimization of Financial Investment. Acquiring a capability generally requires a ﬁnancial investmentof human or physical capital. One way to avoid theinvestment is to outsource design and/or productionto a ﬁrm that already possesses the required capabil-ities. Uncertainty about the future use of a capabilitydecreases the attractiveness of an investment in inter-nalization. Such uncertainty is common in componenttechnologies and ﬁrms may outsource component de-sign and production to a supplier to avoid having to“make a bet” on a single component technology (Bal-akrishnan and Wernerfelt 1986; Lewis and Sappington1991 4). 2.2. Motives for Internalization Since Coase’s seminal work (1937), researchers havedeveloped theories to explain the existence of ﬁrms,i.e. why vertical integration is advantageous. Much ofthis work falls into the category of transaction costeconomics (TCE). This theory is complemented byagency theory and by theories of ﬁrm capabilities de- veloped in the ﬁeld of competitive strategy. Together,these theories present several clear motives for inter-nalization. Asset Speciﬁcity and Potential for “Hold Up.” Transaction cost economics (TCE) is built on the premise that ﬁrms organize to minimize transactioncosts, which include the costs of arranging for andmonitoring the procurement of goods and services. Within the TCE paradigm, these costs can be very highin the presence of speciﬁc assets , those assets that a supplier requires to provide a good or service and thatare unique to the needs of a single customer. William-son (1985) classiﬁes speciﬁc assets as human ,physical , and/or site. In the presence of such assets, both sup- plier and customer face small-numbers bargaining (Wil- liamson 1975) and the associated threat of opportunis-tic behavior on the part of the other party. TCEpredicts that in the presence of speciﬁc assets, ﬁrmswill tend to vertically integrate the activities employ-ing these assets to avoid this risk. These argumentspotentially apply to both design and production ac-tivities. Most of the literature addresses productionactivities where speciﬁc assets include equipment,geographic proximity, or specialized knowledge.However, design may also involve substantial humanasset speciﬁcity in the form of the knowledge andcapabilities of product designers. Pisano (1990) empir-ically validates the role of asset speciﬁcity in the in-ternalization of R&D activities in biotechnology ﬁrms. Competitively Distinctive Capabilities. A central idea in the ﬁeld of competitive strategy is that a ﬁrm isa locus of competitively distinctive capabilities. Be-cause these capabilities can be quite “sticky” (i.e., dif-ﬁcult to transfer), a ﬁrm can develop a competitiveadvantage by investing in their development. SeeTeece, Pisano, and Shuen 1997 for an excellent surveyof the literature on this subject. The development andpreservation of capabilities can be a motive for inter-nalizing design and/or production activities. In situ-ations where the design of a product is competitively distinctive, design capabilities are likely to be impor-tant; and the preservation and development of thosedistinctive capabilities is likely to be enhanced byinternalizing the design activity (Iansiti and Clark1994). There are also appropriability issues associatedwith design and production activities. When outsourc-ing an activity, there is a risk that intellectual propertymay spill over to competitive ﬁrms (Teece 1986). Sim-ilarly, outsourcing an activity to a supplier presents arisk that this supplier may develop into a competitor.These risks may motivate a ﬁrm to internalize activi-ties critical to its competitive advantage. Finally, main-taining internal design and production capabilitiesmay enhance the ability of a ﬁrm to understand andassimilate innovations external to the ﬁrm (Cohen andLevinthal 1990; Parker and Anderson 2002). Task Uncertainty Due to Exogenous Factors. Out- sourcing generally requires that a contract can be writ-ten that anticipates likely contingencies. Creating arobust contract will be difﬁcult in situations wherethere is a high likelihood of an unpredictable exoge-nous disturbance in the task requirements, perhaps 3See Hopp and Spearman 1996, Chapter 8 for a basic discussion of the role of pooling in capacity utilization. 4Lewis and Sappington engage similar issues to Balakrishnan and Wernerfelt, but with differing conclusions.Ulrich and Ellison: Beyond Make-Buy: Internalization and Integration of Design and Production 318 Production and Operations Management 14(3), pp. 315–330, © 2005 Production and Operations Management Societydue to an unexpected change in market requirements. When unanticipated disturbances occur, contract re-negotiation is likely, with the associated small-num-bers bargaining problems. As a result, the ﬁrm is likelyto wish to internalize the activities subject to suchdisturbances (Crocker and Masten 1988; Masten et al.1991). This is a factor often included within TCE and itapplies to both design and production activities. The difﬁculties presented when outsourcing in the presence of asset speciﬁcity or task uncertainty may beovercome in theory by vertical integration. This isbecause for activities and actors within a single legalentity, there is direct authority to compel action with-out litigation. Internalization may also overcome thesedifﬁculties through the development of a sense ofcommunity, a beneﬁcial culture or clan-like behavior(Kogut and Zander 1996; Ouchi 1980). Legal owner-ship may not be strictly necessary to achieve many ofthe beneﬁts of internalization. Dyer (1997) providescompelling evidence of non-ownership modes of inte-gration, such as relational trust, that can allow twoﬁrms to engage in market exchange with diminishedrisks of opportunistic behavior. 2.3. Motives for Integrating Activities From the perspective of the manufacturer, integrationis distinct from internalization when the activities tobe integrated are both candidates for outsourcing, andthe activities could be integrated within a single sup-plier. There are two basic motives for integrating twoactivities into the same organizational entity, evenwhen these activities are external to the manufacturer. Difﬁculty Measuring the Quality of Output of a Precedent Activity. There is a strong motive to inte- grate two interrelated activities A and B into the sameorganizational entity when the output of Activity A isrequired for completion of the Activity B, and whenthe quality of the output of Activity A is difﬁcult toassess. Such situations present classic agency prob-lems in that
