{"text": "\u2018\u2018Open\u2019\u2019 refers to the nature of the relationship between assemblers and suppliers, who are free to design and develop parts independently and thus able to work with multiple firms due to the high degree of product modularity (Baldwin and Clark, 1997).", "label": "1"}
{"text": "The O-M structure typically results in increased competition and lower costs", "label": "1"}
{"text": "In a closed-integral (C-I) architecture, assemblers work together closely with a few key suppliers to develop a product in a top-down approach. The assemblers develop high technical capability and in turn nurture this capability in their few trusted suppliers", "label": "1"}
{"text": "E2Ws also meet the second and third criteria of modularity: simple interfaces with minimal information exchange. For instance, the core modules of the drivetrain are connected through electrical wire interfaces. This both increases design flexibility and reduces assembly cost.", "label": "1"}

{"text": "The viability of the Dual Separate option depends on whether technical factors allow the partitioning of the project into fairly independent spheres of activity.

{"text": "There is, however, a major project organization issue present. Because each partner is similarly equipped to undertake the project, there is no natural way for them to agree upon which one will do it, and until this issue is resolved, the selected company cannot get started.

{"text": "Electricity-generating capacity is another potential constraint to EV growth. Rolling brownouts were common throughout China in 2004 due to demand for electricity out-stripping peak production.
