,Bonvoisin,1,Various criteria as well as step-by-step methods for modular product design have been developed and published that allow supporting the process of grouping elements into modules and of defining interfaces.,0,
,Bonvoisin,2,"However, methods and criteria have been generally defined conjointly and, therefore, it is not directly possible to use one method with a criterion for which it has not been developed. ",0,
,Bonvoisin,3,This constitutes a limitation in the support these methods can offer to the use of product modularisation in the development of sustain able products.,0,
,Bonvoisin,4,"Based on a systematic literature review (SLR), it presents an exhaustive compilation of published criteria for product modularisation and gives insights into the further development of a target oriented modularisation method.",0,
,Bonvoisin,5," Product modularisation fails to get precisely defined because this term describes a large field of practices rather than a defined method, sometimes leading to misunderstandings.",0,
,Bonvoisin,6,"The objective of this section is to first explain this field and provide appropriate definitions for a general understanding, and then introduce the research question this paper addresses.",0,
,Bonvoisin,7,"The greatest common denominator of the available definitions of the concept of ‘a module’ is that it is a group of functional carriers (such as components or parts, or physical elements in a product that contribute to a given function or a set of functions).",0,
,Bonvoisin,8,he concept can also be extended to services (e.g. Song et al. 2015) where modules can be considered as groups of service components leading to a partial function of the overall service or product service system (PSS).,0,
,Bonvoisin,9,"Modular product design can be broken down into three different and potentially complementary activities: design with modules, identifying modules and design of modules (Liang and Huang 2002).",0,
,Bonvoisin,10," Identifying modules entails considering an existing product, evaluating the relevance of a component grouping, clustering those components accordingly and, eventually, redesigning and integrating the so-defined modules and corresponding interfaces",0,
,Bonvoisin,11,This definition is narrower than that of modular product design and excludes design with Modules.,0,
,Bonvoisin,12,"The field of approaches in modular product design is summarised in Figure 1. In this article, we focus on product modularisation and, therefore, only concentrate on design of modules and identifying modules – two approaches that are further described in the following subsections.",0,
,Bonvoisin,13,"The works cited here show that, while several drivers of product modularisation have been identified, authors do not agree on their scope and on the rationale of their classification.",0,
,Bonvoisin,14,"Along those lines, Smith and Yen (2010) compared product modularity with an atomic model: While atoms are made up of particles that attract or repel each other according to their electrical charge, products are made up of functional carriers that have more or less affinity to each other.",0,
,Bonvoisin,15,"Depending on the objective followed in the modularisation process, these generic properties can be instantiated into more specific indicators, called modularity metrics among which similarity and dependency metrics (Hölttä-Otto et al. 2012) can be distinguished.",0,
,Bonvoisin,16,"A similarity metric can be, for example, instantiated by the type of handling tools used in an assembly process chain (e.g. Lai and Gershenson 2008), the expected technical and value lifetimes of  components (e.g.Tchertchian, Millet, and Pialot 2011), the end-of-life intent of components (e.g. Newcomb, Bras, and Rosen 1998) or the material compatibility for recycling processes (e.g. Qian and Zhang 2003).",0,
,Bonvoisin,17,"As a result, the modularisation process consists of clustering functional carriers into modules that maximises the intra-module similarity and the inter-module independency.",0,
,Bonvoisin,18,"Published methods implementing this generic procedure are for example presented in Lai and Gershenson (2008), Hsiao et al. (2013), Ji et al. (2013), Kusiak and Huang (1997), Newcomb, Bras, and Rosen (1998), Pimmler and Eppinger (1994), Qian and Zhang (2003).",0,
,Bonvoisin,19,"Unfortunately, the unambiguous definition of interactions between functional carriers (i.e. definition of reproducible similarity and dependency metrics) remains to date one of the less regarded topics in product modularisation.",0,
,Bonvoisin,20,"As a result, it is still difficult for engineers to have a clear view on the wide range of metrics that can be used and product design teams are provided with insufficient support for choosing and implementing the appropriate metrics corresponding to their design goals and for generating high quality input data for modularisation methods. ",0,
,Bonvoisin,21,"Furthermore, the modularisation methods presented in the literature may be idiosyncratic to the modularisation metric(s) they implement.",0,
,Bonvoisin,22,"Each method presented in literature is developed, or at least presented, for a given modularisation metric or a set of modularisation metrics. The use of the same method in the pursuit of other goals requires an adaptation and, therefore, further time-costly methodological developments.",0,
,Bonvoisin,23,"With this background, the problem nowadays seems to be less the lack of methodological support in modularisation than that of choosing the most suitable metrics/drivers (in terms of quality and objective) and methods from the many available. ",0,
,Bonvoisin,24,Such an overview could support engineers finding the adapted criteria in order to follow their product development strategy through product modularisation.,0,
,Bonvoisin,25,"In the present article, the authors advocate for the development of a multi-purpose product modularisation method – one that could be defined independently of any modularisation metric and used conjointly with a metric database allowing engineers to pick the metrics that fit in with their design objectives. ",0,
,Bonvoisin,26,"The present article concentrates on the first aspect of the research programme introduced in the previous section, that is, clarifying what can modularity used for.",0,

,brusoni,33,"Overall, modularity has been proposed as a powerful organizing principle of the evolutionary processes of both artificial and natural complex systems.",0,

,brusoni,35,"Modularity emerges as a specific kind of problem-solving strategy, which entails a specific pattern of knowledge and tasks partitioning.",0,
,brusoni,36,"On this basis, formal models start from the already set grammar, or rules, and focusses on the exploitative aspects of modular design principles (Baldwin and Clark, 2000)",0,
,brusoni,37,We approach instead modularity as a specific example of problem-solving strategy,0,
,brusoni,38,We can consider product development as an example of problem-solving activity regularly taking place in firms and also across firms.,0,
,brusoni,39,On the other hand non-modular or integral search modules and interfaces are not pre-defined and search takes place by varying potentially all components together and accepting new product if its performance is higher,0,
,brusoni,40,"More specifically, this paper develops a formal model, broadly inspired by Stuart Kauffman’s work on fitness landscapes (Kauffman, 1993), in order to shed some light on two related questions concerning the dynamic properties of modular search strategies",0,
,brusoni,41,The next section focusses on recent empirical research on modularity to highlight a few facts that demand an explanation and outlines our problem-solving perspective.,0,
,brusoni,42,"One of the fundamental contributions of recent research on modularity is the identification of a series of constructs and key relationships that allows studying the connection between what firms do, how they do it, and what they need to know in order to do it.",0,
,brusoni,43,"Research on modularity reminds us about the complexity of the relationship between conceptualizations of firms as knowledge structures, and of firms as producers of goods and services.",0,
,brusoni,44,"First, in the context of increasingly globalized markets, ever more complex supply chains, and international manufacturing networks, corporate decision-making processes involve more and more actors, variables and criteria that lead to less and less transparency about who is deciding what, and on what basis.",0,
,brusoni,45,"Management tasks increasingly involve the monitoring, control, and coordination of a widening range of useful, but highly heterogeneous, scientific, and technological disciplines that are embodied in products of increasing complexity, in terms of components and functionalities.",0,
,brusoni,46,"The advantages of modularity seem to be particularly compelling in high technology settings, such as the aircraft engine industry.",0,
,brusoni,47,"In a three-shaft engine, the compression work is split across three compressors (low-, intermediate-, and high-pressure).",0,
,brusoni,48,Each compressor can be driven by its own turbine at its optimum speed.,0,
,brusoni,49,In a three-shaft design the mapping between functions and physical structures tends to be more one to one.,0,
,brusoni,50,"In a two-shaft design, in fact, the compression work is split between two compressors.",0,
,brusoni,51,This limits the compression that can be achieved in the first part of the engine leaving high duty on the high-pressure compressor,0,
,brusoni,52, The three-shaft architecture has been instead characterized by higher thrust growth.,0,
,brusoni,53,"Moreover, increasing division of labour among firms also entail the traditional costs associated with the use of the market system (i.e. transaction costs) as well as agency costs related to the hold-up problem.",0,
,brusoni,54,One must also consider the costs of the foregone opportunities that might have been exploited adopting different architectural choices,0,
,brusoni,55,"Not only does learning about the architecture require dedicated efforts, but it also entails different kinds of organizations, people, and skills (Brusoni and Prencipe, 2001).",0,
,brusoni,56,This change of orientation is what ‘systems integrating’ firms can do.,0,
,brusoni,57,The case of Fujitsu exemplifies the role played by systems integrator in the case of the hard disk drive network.,0,
,brusoni,58,"Specifically, Davies argued that the key advantage of Ericsson, the world leader throughout the 1990s, was its constant involvement in both architectural and component innovations, as well as its efforts to control production costs",0,
,brusoni,59,"The problem space is an extension and generalization of Kauffman’s NK model of fitness landscapes (Kauffman, 1993).",0,
,brusoni,60,A fitness landscape is simply a mapping from a vector characterizing an entity’s form to a payoff value.,0,
,brusoni,61,"In particular, we develop and use two notions of complexity of a problem environment, namely decompositions and near-decompositions, which give a precise indication of the degree to which the problem can be decomposed into independent or quasi-independent sub-problems (modules).",0,
,brusoni,62,A decomposition scheme is a sort of template that determines how new configurations are generated and can therefore be tested by a selection mechanism.,0,
,brusoni,63,"We will assume that boundedly rational agents can only search locally in directions that are given by the decomposition scheme: new configurations are generated and tested in the neighbourhood of the given one, where neighbours are new configurations obtained by changing some (possibly all) components within a given module.",0,
,brusoni,64,"Among all the decomposition schemes of a given problem, we are especially interested in those for which the global optimum becomes reachable from any initial configuration.",0,
,clark,65,The introduction of new products has been an important activity in manufacturing businesses since at least the mid- 19th century.,0,
,Clark,66,The importance of product development has motivated significant attention to the determinants of performance by both practitioners and academics.,0,
,Clark,67,Project scope determines what part of the development effort will be done by the internal project team.,0,
,Clark,68,I first examine scope and engineering manhours and then consider the impact on lead time.,0,
,Clark,69,The development of a product like the automobile is a complex set of activities involving many people over long periods of time.,0,
,Clark,70,"Thus, most of the Japanese firms use suppliers to sustain development of more uniquely designed products without substantially increasing their internal engineering workforce.",0,
,Clark,71,"While existing evidence on long-term relationships, the network of direct and indirect suppliers and extensive involvement of suppliers in operations in the Japanese auto industry primarily has come from studies on parts manufacturing, the information developed in this study suggests that differences in supplier manufacturing relationships also carry over into the design and development of the product.",0,
,Clark,72," Although supplier management has been in transition in the U.S. companies, the projects in our sample were heavily influenced by the traditional system in which suppliers produced parts under short-term, arm's-length contracts and had little role in design and engineering.",0,
,Clark,73,Direct adjustment suggests that scope accounts for an important part of the differences in observed project hours,0,
,Clark,74," The Japan dummy picks up a significant fraction of the variance in the data and shows that little of the ""Japan effect"" is associated with product content differences.",0,
,Clark,75,"Adding measures of project scope has a dramatic effect on the regression. Entered in linear form, NH has a strong impact on project hours, and explains a sizeable fraction of the variance in the data.",0,
,Clark,76,"his difference is statistically significant at about the ten percent level on a one-tailed test, and its size suggests that scope is a more important element in explaining the efficiency of the development process in Japan than we estimated through direct adjustment of the manhours data.",0,
,Clark,77,The coefficients on body types and vehicle price increase sharply when NH is introduced into the regression,0,
,Clark,78,"However, the parameter estimates in Table 3 (which relax the equal productivity assumption) imply that such a change in NH would add almost 1.0 million hours to the internal engineering effort. The implication is that engineering work outside the firm is more efficient, less difficult, or both.",0,¼
,Clark,79,Evidence from interviews and further statistical analysis suggests that both differences in efficiency and degree of difficulty may be at work in the sample.,0,
,Clark,80,"While the estimated impact of supplier involvement is not statistically different from what one would expect under the equal productivity model, the evidence suggests that supplier relationships are an important element in an efficient engineering system. One piece of evidence is the strong relationship between the supplier variable and the Japanese dummy. ",0,
,Clark,81,"When one excludes the Japanese dummy from the regression in column 4, for example, the coefficient on the supplier variable increases by a factor of 2.7, while its standard error declines slightly (i.e. the coefficient is -9772 with a standard of 2025). Thus the supplier effect on manhours is closely related to the complex of organizational and managerial factors captured in the Japanese dummy.",0,
,Clark,82,"These results confirm the importance of suppliers in the Japanese manhour advantage, but they also suggest that attempts to decompose development efficiency into an in-house piece and a supplier piece may miss the importance of the total development system linking assemblers and suppliers. If, as is the case in the Japanese auto industry, suppliers and assemblers have integrated their engineering activities, efficiency in one group depends on efficiency in the other.",0,
,Clark,83,"Further, it is the efficiency of the whole, not the parts, that matters, and the data suggest that the integrated system in Japan is highly efficient.",0,
,Clark,84,The ability of the Japanese firms to operate efficiently while using a larger fraction of unique parts is due in significant part to the capability of the supplier network.,0,
,Clark,85,"The field interviews conducted in this study underscore the importance of the supplier network. Especially among the U.S. firms, but also in Europe, one finds a move in the last few years toward greater use of suppliers for engineering work, and a significant change in the nature of supplier relationships.",0,
,Clark,86,"In the early stages of a program, for example, much of the work involves concept development and product planning. While some of the early exterior design work may be done by outside design firms, and while suppliers may have some involvement in planning, most of the early stage work is done in-house.",0,
,Clark,87,"The empirical work in this section is designed to establish the direction and magnitude of the scope-time relationship, and may shed some light on the relative importance of coordination costs and supplier capability",0,
,Clark,88,"Thus, any observed relationship between scope and planning time is likely to reflect coordination costs rather than the speed of the suppliers. Supplier capability may play a more important role in the engineering phase of the project where the bulk of the parts- related effort occurs.",0,
,Clark,89,"This may occur because certain tasks are common to all projects, are on the critical path, and have relatively fixed length independent of overall content.",0,
,Clark,90,"The results also suggest, however, that a modest part of the Japanese advantage in lead time comes from differences in product content; without the product content variables in the equation, the Japanese dummy has a coefficient of -18.6, with a standard error of 3.00.",0,
,Clark,91,This impact appears to be quite similar among different kinds of cars. Entering an interaction term between price and NH has little impact. The interaction term is insignificant and other estimates are not affected,0,
,Clark,92,These results present a picture quite similar to the one developed for engineering manhours.,0,
,Clark,93,"The supplier variable, on the other hand, appears to explain at least some part of the Japanese advantage.",0,
,Clark,94,"However, the size of the standard errors, and the sensitivity of the results to functional form, suggest caution about the size of the impact.",0,
,Clark,95,"Dividing overall lead time into a planning stage and an engineering stage provides additional insight into the effects of scope. Planning begins with concept study and ends with top management approval of the project; the post-approval stage begins with program approval, includes the bulk of the engineering work on the product and process, and ends with market introduction. ",0,
,Clark,96,"Coupled with the fact that the number of people increases, the broader set of issues means that more organizations need to be involved (and involved more intensively) in the planning process. Both of these effects could lead to the need for more, and more intense, communication linkages and thus more time to complete planning.",0,
,Danese,97,Customers expect new products even more quickly than before and in this environment a company must explore all available opportunities for shortening the time-to-market for new products.,0,
,Danese,98,"These authors do not explicitly address the impact on NPD time. Instead Lau et al. (2007, 2010), as well as considering the impact of product modularity on manufacturing capabilities (i.e. flexibility and customer service), take into account also product performance, measured in terms of customer satisfaction, achievement of sales and profit goals and profitability of products.",0,
,Danese,99,"In addition, some authors suggest that in order to better understand how companies can improve performances, product modularity, interfunctional integration and supplier involvement in the NPD process should be analyzed in a comprehensive way.",0,
,Danese,100,A moderator variable affects the direction and/or the strength of a relation between an independent and dependent variable.,0,
,Danese,101,"The aim of this study is twofold. On the one hand, it intends to investigate whether product modularity has a significant positive effect on NPD time performance.",0,
,Danese,102,"Modularity arises from the decomposition of a product into independent subassemblies/chunks and components, referred to as product modules.",0,
,Danese,103,"Even though the above-mentioned benefits of product modularity have been discussed by several researchers, there is rarely empirical evidence of these advantages.",0,
,Danese,104,"Suppliers’ involvement in the NPD process may range from simple consultation on design ideas and quality problems, to their active participation in product development projects (Fliess and Becker, 2006).",0,33.02%
,Danese,105,"In addition, including suppliers in producer’s NPD team and coordinating communication and information exchanges between producers and suppliers allow potential problems to be identified so they can be resolved up front, and thus reduce delays and ensure the project is completed on time.",0,
,Danese,106,"Instead, empirical research investigating the moderating effect of supplier involvement on the product modularity-NPD time performance relationship is lacking.",0,
,Danese,107,This collaboration between buyer and suppliers requires involving suppliers in the NPD process to reach an agreement over the design of the common product interfaces and exchange frequent feedbacks on prototype trials. ,0,
,Danese,108,Developing commercially successful new products requires analyzing market and technological possibilities and translating these into actual products.,0,
,Danese,109,"This entails creating knowledge which spans functional areas, with the aim of understanding customer needs, product capabilities and requirements, emerging trends, product feasibility, etc. In this way, potential problems and disagreements that could emerge during the NPD process are discussed and resolved earlier, in the first phases of the development process. ",0,
,Danese,110,"n fact, as explained before, in this case, coordination between different functions is needed to carefully evaluate product concept generation and system-level design, and to clearly define module functions and Interfaces.",0,
,Danese,111,"This study uses data from the third round of the high performance manufacturing (HPM) project data set. Data were collected during the 2005-2007 timeframe by an international team of researchers working in different universities all over the world and include responses from manufacturing plants operating in mechanical, electronic and transportation equipment sectors and located in different countries: Finland, the USA, Japan, Germany, Sweden, Korea, Italy and Austria.",0,
,Danese,112,"All plants represented different parent corporations, and had at least 100 employees. Each plant received a batch of questionnaires.

,Danese,116,"A total of 244 plants returned the questionnaires. Given the purpose of this study, 55 of these were discarded since they provided incomplete responses on the items of interest, or did not perform internally NPD activities, and thus did not have an independent organizational structure for NPD.",0,
,Danese,117,"We verified that each plant had developed some new products in the previous five years, thus our study avoids taking into consideration those plants that rarely develop new or modified products.",0,
,Danese,118,The mean number of employees of the plants Modularity impact on NPD 1197 in the sample was 933.89 (number of hourly and salaried personnel). We use size (as well as industry) as a control variable later in the analysis to test whether this had any impact on NPD time performance.,0,
,Danese,119,"In order to test the unidimensionality of the different constructs, a principal component factor analysis by Varimax rotation was implemented.",0,
,Danese,120,"Together these tests indicate convergent validity. Finally, for each pair of constructs, we verified that the variance-extracted was higher than the square of the correlation estimate between the two constructs. This reflects high discriminant validity.",0,
,Danese,121,The mechanical sector was arbitrarily taken as the baseline/comparison group. ,0,
,Danese,122,"n addition, to address the problem of multicollinearity, we follow the procedure recommended by several authors, namely that of using mean-centered data in the independent variables (Jaccard and Turrisi, 2003). When the b-coefficient of the interaction term is statistically significant, and R 2 increases when this term is introduced in the model, the existence of a moderated effect is demonstrated.",0,
,Danese,123,"However, having a significant marginal effect for some values of the moderating variable is not particularly interesting if real-world observations rarely fall within this range.",0,
,Danese,124,"To further gain an intuitive understanding of the interaction effect between M and II, we computed and graphed the slope of NPD time performance on M at a few different values of II. ",0,
,Danese,125,This study provides a number of original implications on the role that product modularity and integration practices can play to reduce NPD time performance.,0,
,Danese,126,"On the other hand, the results found offer new insights on the importance of interfunctional integration in order to fully exploit the M-TP relationship. In particular, our analyses demonstrate that when the moderating effect of II on M-TP relationship is accounted for, there is a significant impact on TP of the interaction between M and II (see model 3 in Table IV).",0,
,Danese,127,"For instance, if the different teams of designers develop their modules autonomously, but there is no precise agreement on how each module should contribute to the overall function of the product, or on the goals of the NPD project (e.g. reducing product costs), it may happen that some modules must be redesigned several times during the NPD process, because they are not consistent with the project’s requirements, or because the project’s requirements change over time to take into consideration some additional advice/suggestions which had not been considered before.",0,

,Huang,138,"Value engineering is primarily concerned with product function and costs. Producibility engineering, on the other hand, assures that product speci®cations can be met with available or potentially available techniques, tooling, and test equipment at costs compatible with the product's selling price.",0,
,Huang,139,"By using value and producibility engineering, design engineers attempt to optimize the design to maximize the profit of accomplishing intended functions. However, three problems are encountered in the traditional manufacturing system using value and producibility engineering.",0,
