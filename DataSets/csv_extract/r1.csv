Extra directions mean wasted time and motion as well as more transfer stations, inspection station and fixture nests. The best possible assembly is when all parts are added in a top-down fashion to create a Z-axis stack.",
ST-350,N/A,SR-016,"The following is a list of DFA criteria (Corbett, 1987): 1. Minimize the number of (1) parts and fixings, (2) design variants, (3) assembly movements, and (4) assembly directions. 2. Provide (1) suitable lead-in chamfers, (2) automatic alignment, (3) easy access for locating surfaces, (4) symmetrical parts, or exaggerate asymmetry, and (5) simple handling and transportation. 3. Avoid (1) visual obstructions, (2) simultaneous fitting operations, (3) parts which will tangle or `nest', (4) adjustments which affect prior adjustments, and (5) the possibility of assembly errors.",
ST-351,N/A,SR-016,"Ishii, Lee and Eubanks (1995) proposed the concept of clumping for disassembly and recycle. A clump is a collection of components and/or subassemblies that share a common characteristic based on user intent. Material compatibility is a major issue in clumping for product retirement. The designer may need to clump components that are not compatible due to certain constraints. If the post-life intent of the product is to be recycled and if materials in the clump are not compatible, then the mechanical connections among the components should be easily broken, i.e. using snap fits, press-fits, screws, and screw insert. If the intent of the designer is to clump for disposal, neither the material nor the fastening method is important.",
