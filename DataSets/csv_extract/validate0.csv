"In an open-modular (O-M) industry, manufacturers act
primarily as assemblers and source components (‘‘modules’’)
produced by a large decentralized network of suppliers. This type
of structure is typically found when a product exhibits high
modularity, meaning it can be divided into several modules that
are copied, mass-produced, standardized, and easily bought on
the market.",1
"‘‘Open’’ refers to the nature of the relationship between assemblers and suppliers, who are free to design and develop parts independently and thus able to work with multiple firms due to the high degree of product modularity (Baldwin and Clark, 1997).",1
The O-M structure typically results in increased competition and lower costs,1
"In a closed-integral (C-I) architecture, assemblers work together closely with a few key suppliers to develop a product in a top-down approach. The assemblers develop high technical capability and in turn nurture this capability in their few trusted suppliers",1
"The emergence of open-modular industries is a relatively recent phenomenon, and its effect on innovation has been the subject of much analysis (Steinfeld, 2002; Sturgeon, 2002; Tapscott and Williams, 2007; Yusuf and al., 2003). They conclude that this structure (along with other factors) leads to lower production costs compared with a closed-industry structure due to enhanced competition and cross-pollination of ideas.",1
"The key drawback of this structure, however, is that assembler firms do not develop as much technological capability and thus risk the threat of ‘‘technology lock-in’’.",1
"E2Ws also meet the second and third criteria of modularity: simple interfaces with minimal information exchange. For instance, the core modules of the drivetrain are connected through electrical wire interfaces. This both increases design flexibility and reduces assembly cost.",1
"Machining is not required at the assembly plant because components are pre-fabricated, and interfaces exhibit greater tolerance to error.",1
"Designers also have more flexibility in positioning modules to enhance comfort, convenience, and styling, as seen in the various models shown in Fig. 4 (folding E2W, standard E2W, and e-scooter).",1
"Interface flexibility and simple information exchange between the interfaces of E2W are one of reason for the wide variance in body style (e.g. E2W vs. e-scooter), module positioning,",1
"The highly modular nature of E2Ws has led to standardized sizes, performance levels, and interfaces",1
"Once standardized, components become easily interchangeable between models and manufacturers, giving assemblers and suppliers more freedom in their choices for partners and facilitating a more open industry structure.",1
"Because a supplier’s product can potentially be sold to many different assemblers, it leads to increased production volume and lower cost",1
Standardization also facilitates substitution of competing battery or motor technologies with little or no redesign required of the other modules. This allows for faster design changes and technology upgrading.,1
"Standardized technology with simple interfaces has lowered the barriers to entry into this industry, another reason for the large number of firms in the industry.",1
E2W and battery manufacturers are already expanding into producing higher-margin product lines due to the competitive nature of an open-modular industry structure. Companies typically expand into higher-margin product lines to escape fierce cost competition in the existing low-margin product line.,1
"The viability of the Dual Separate option depends on whether technical factors allow the partitioning of the project into fairly independent spheres of activity. In other words, sufficient standardization must exist so that the technical interfaces between the two spheres can be decoupled (Ulrich 1995, Baldwin and Clark 2000, Schilling 2000)",1
"To avoid problems of opportunism, each firm’s sphere must contain some aspect essential to the new product’s functioning. Otherwise, the disadvantaged partner may regret its potential dependence on the other. When no project partition meets these two criteria, Dual Integrated (Consensus) becomes the only viable option",1
"There is, however, a major project organization issue present. Because each partner is similarly equipped to undertake the project, there is no natural way for them to agree upon which one will do it, and until this issue is resolved, the selected company cannot get started. This is, then, an early critical path issue with significant potential for reducing sales revenues.",0
Our second objective is to identify the considerations entering into the selection of the appropriate project organization option for a new product development project. This section deals with the choices at the start of a contractual alliance among first-time partners doing multiple new product development.,0
Table 3 demonstrates that the Single and Dual Integrated (Manager) options are dominated by Dual Integrated (Consensus).,0
"If Dual Separate is not technically viable, then Dual Integrated (Consensus) becomes the only recourse, hence, the asymmetric learning counterpart of Proposition 3 has the same choice of option. To do the project, and perhaps to maintain the alliance, the firm expecting the least learning will accept the situation.",0
"Because moving to Condition Ia from Condition I does not disturb the rankings of the project organization options on the separate costs and benefits, the counterparts of Propositions 1 and 2 choose the same options.",0
The Single option is ruled out because our concern is only with an alliance in which at least some joint new product development occurs.,0
"Electricity-generating capacity is another potential constraint to EV growth. Rolling brownouts were common throughout China in 2004 due to demand for electricity out-stripping peak production. In 2007, manufacturers in Gaungdong Province experienced several brownout alerts due to tight electricity supply (Greising, 2007).",0
"The largest is the issue of recharging infrastructure, which will need to be built since EV batteries are not portable like E2W batteries.",0
"To capitalize on the full benefits of electric-drive transport, policy makers in China should consider measures to lower the carbon intensity of the grid. The recently passed Renewable Portfolio Standard and increasing crackdown on small inefficient coal power plants are examples of policies that will help achieve that goal.",0
"An indicator of E2W technology improvement is their increasing size, power, and speed. At the Zhejiang E2W Exhibition in October 2007, seven manufacturers displayed E2Ws with 500W, 60 V battery systems and regenerative braking.",0
"Vehicle ownership statistics may underestimate the degree of E2W use in China’s cities. Based on limited surveying by the author in 10 cities (small, medium and large), E2Ws make up 28% of total two-wheeler traffic on average, compared with 57% bicycles and 15% G2Ws.",0
"FFA, created by Kurt Lewin (1952), was originally used to study organizational behavior and group dynamics.",0
"The majority of this vehicle growth over the next two decades will occur in non-OECD countries, with the largest growth expected in China and India.",0
Electric two-wheelers (E2Ws) are gaining widespread acceptance in China; it is arguably the most successful electric-drive market in the world.,0
It is likely that E2Ws will continue to substitute for bicycles and public transit as incomes rise in China.,0
"At the alliance level, firms typically have either broadly similar or broadly cospecialized skills (Hennart et al. 1999), but the distribution of specific skills between the partners at the project level may vary across projects.",0
"Perhaps surprisingly, a cooperative history (because of prior alliances or the evolution of this alliance) has little effect on the propositions.",0
"They include the amount of authority for the project manager, degree of collocation, type of reward system, and the business and technical functions to be represented on the team.",0
