manufacturing system, in all cases. The work described in this paper attempts to generate such a set of axioms. Two example axioms are: (1) minimize the number of functional requirements and constraints, (2) satisfy the primary functional require- ment first. Satisfy the others in order of importance. Sussman t2 introduces the idea of constraint nets as a computational structure. Rather than expressing mathe- matical relations as a unilateral procedure for computing certain values in terms of others, constraints express only the relationship between quantities. The constraint net can be used to compute a selected quantity from the remaining quantities. The other major idea in this paper is that of almost-hierarchical descriptions. This term is used to denote the fact that engineered devices have roughly hierarchial relations between functional descrip- tions and their structural implementations, but that this relation is sometimes muddled by function sharing in the design. Sussman introduces a concept called slices to deal with these almost-hierarchical descriptions.
